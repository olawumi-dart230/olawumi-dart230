    <h1>Love is all I need</h1>
    <h2>By, Olawumi Hassan</h2>
    
    
    <p><br>Recent years of not knowing the true definition of love, <br>  
       Because you never had a view of what true love is.<br>
       Living with a divored parent trying to figure out<br>
       How her failed marriage won't influence her daughter's view of love. <br>
       Waking up every morning praying to find love myself, <br>
       After having my heart broken for the past two years. <br>
       Having the thought that you've finally found someone <br>
       Who actually loves you, and you're filled with joy <br>
       Telling all yourfriends that you have met the one. <br>
       Just to find out days later he isn't what you think he is. <br>
       Waking up asking yourself why doesn't nothing work out for you. <br>
       But praying that one day you will have what you deserve. <br>
